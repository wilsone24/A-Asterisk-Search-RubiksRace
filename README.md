## 🚀 Features  

- Implementation of the **A*** algorithm with `heapq` for efficient optimal path search.  
- Validation and manipulation of Rubik’s Race boards.  
- Heuristic calculations to improve A* search.  
- Functions for generating and visualizing the board in text and colors.  
- Translation of moves into readable sequences.  

## 🖥 Requirements  

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Required libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

```

## 🛠 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/A_Search_RubiksRace.git
   cd A_Search_RubiksRace
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run `A_Search_Rubik’sRace.ipynb`.

## 🎮 Usage Example  

When executing the notebook, the following steps will be visualized:  
- **Loading the initial board.**  
- **Locating the empty space and generating possible moves.**  
- **Applying the A* algorithm to find the optimal solution.**  
- **Visualizing the board before and after applying the moves.**
